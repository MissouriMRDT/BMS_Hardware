Battery Management System- this year it DOES THINGS (for real though!).

New for 2022:
-Designed to monitor an 8s8p LiPo battery pack at a max 33.6V @ 160A peak.
-The Cell Monitoring circuit uses the AS358MTR-E1 Op-Amp as it could be powered off of pack voltage.
-Teensy 4.1 used as microcontroller for the board.
